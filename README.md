# ableton-parser
 
Extract structured metadata and plugin info from `.als` files (Ableton Live projects).

This script generates:
- A full `.xml` version of your `.als` file
- A `.csv` with track names, clips, and sample file references
- A `.txt` summary of all Ableton and third-party plugins used
- A per-track plugin breakdown `.txt` file
